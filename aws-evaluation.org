# EXPORT SETUP

# 1. Ensure exports include both source block contents and any results
#+PROPERTY: header-args :exports both

# 2. Suppress author in title, and prevent ^ and _ from initiating super and subscript....
#     N.B. can still use the braced forms -- i.e. 'bla^{super}_{sub}'
#+OPTIONS: author:nil ^:nil

# 3. HTML export theme
#+SETUPFILE: ~/Documents/templates/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup

# 4. ODT (and DOCX) export styles/theme
#    N.B. Editing the ODT can cause the embedded logo jpg name to change... if this occurs, unzip the odt to check the new name and update this line
#+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ("~/Documents/templates/nmd-template.odt" ("styles.xml" "content.xml" "Pictures/1000000000000A4F000004659ACFB30B1A81D55F.jpg"))


# Startup options : Want to view rendered versions of latex fragments (equations etc.) by default
#+STARTUP:: latexpreview


Initial backend evaluation used AWS amplify.

* AWS integration
This project includes some (now disabled -- see below) integration with AWS via amplify.
Initially used the =@aws-amplify/ui-react= package to provide their auth component, which is pretty bloated -- including just the auth component makes the build jump from 275 files to 1243 files.

** Services to integrate
- [X] Amplify (meta/configuration)
- [X] Cognito (auth)
- [ ] S3 (file storage)

** References
- [[https://www.arthurbrrs.me/pre-signed-s3-clojurescript.html][Pre-signed uploads to AWS S3 using Clojure(script)]] :: Excellent clear (and detailed) blog post from 2022 on uploads to AWS S3, using re-frame coeffects etc.

** AWS local environment setup
For instructions on setting up your amplify environment, see here: https://docs.amplify.aws/react/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/

This is required to generate the aws-exports.js needed for the build.

** AWS dependency patching / post-installation steps
A couple of the aws dependencies have some post-installation steps -- a script has been provided to automate this:
[[./patch-aws-dependencies.sh]]

This should be run...
1. After running ~yarn install~.
2. After updating the =@aws-amplify/ui-react= package.
